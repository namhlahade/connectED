## Description

Our project aims to facilitate seamless connections among students seeking academic assistance and those proficient in various subjects. Oftentimes students find themselves stuck studying while there are no office hours available or waiting until the last minute to get work done, so our app looks to help students in those situations. Furthermore, out app looks to leverage proximity to find the best matches between students.

Key features of our app include:

1. **Expertise Matching**: Students can easily find peers who excel in the subjects they need assistance with, ensuring tailored support for their academic challenges. Peer connections will be made based off proximity and shared availibity between users.

2. **Research Collaboration**: Beyond academic support, our app also serves as a platform for graduate students to recruit participants for surveys or experiments, addressing the common challenge of finding suitable candidates for their studies.

3. **Rating and Feedback System**: Users can rate and provide feedback on their experiences working with mentor students.

## iOS/API Technologies

* MapKit API
  * Alert users of nearby users to assist with matching process
* EventKit API
  * Facilitate reminders and scheduling management
* PhotoService/Transferable Protocol
  * Post images of work to get feedback or help

## Sources of Complexity
* Finding optimal matches using an algorithm based on proximity and availbility
* Integrating the APIs into our app to obtain data for the algorithm
