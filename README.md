ConnectED

## Description

Our project aims to facilitate seamless connections among students seeking academic assistance and those proficient in various subjects. Oftentimes students find themselves stuck studying while there are no office hours available or waiting until the last minute to get work done, so our app looks to help students in those situations. Furthermore, our app looks to leverage proximity to find the best matches between students.

Key features of our app include:

1. **Expertise Matching**: Students can easily find peers who excel in the classes/subjects they need assistance with, ensuring tailored support for their academic challenges. Peer connections will be made based off geographic proximity and shared time-availability between users.

2. **Research Collaboration**: Beyond academic support, our app also serves as a platform for graduate students to recruit participants for surveys or experiments, addressing the common challenge of finding suitable candidates for their research.

3. **Rating and Feedback System**: Users can rate and provide feedback on their experiences working with mentor students, which can be used by future students to select the optimal mentor.

## iOS/API Technologies

* MapKit API
  * Allow users to see nearby mentors to assist with matching process
* EventKit API
  * Facilitate reminders and scheduling management
* PhotoService/Transferable Protocol
  * Post images of work to get feedback or help

## Sources of Complexity
* Finding optimal matches using an algorithm based on geographic proximity and time availability
* Integrating the APIs into our app to obtain data for the algorithm
